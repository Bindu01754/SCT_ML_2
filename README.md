Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Machine Learning

Project Description:

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and classify hand gestures through a webcam feed. The system leverages MediaPipe for hand landmark extraction and a trained machine learning model for gesture classification. It demonstrates key steps in an applied computer vision pipeline, including landmark feature extraction, model integration, real-time inference, and visualization of predictions. The project provides practical exposure to building interactive AI systems for human–computer interaction.
